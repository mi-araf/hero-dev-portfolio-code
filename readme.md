## Prompt 1: Professional Man (Corporate Headshot)
```bash
Create a professional studio portrait of a smiling, smart, and confident man, using the reference image.
Preserve the exact face, facial structure, skin tone, hairstyle, beard, and overall identity from the original image. Do not alter identity.

Pose: standing straight with a confident posture, arms crossed — left forearm horizontal across the torso, right arm placed over it, right hand tucked under the left bicep.

Outfit: navy blue blazer, light blue formal shirt, no tie.

Lighting: soft professional studio lighting, evenly lit face with gentle natural shadows for depth.

Background: solid black, clean and distraction-free.

Camera & Style: eye-level angle, mid-torso to head framing, corporate headshot, ultra-realistic, DSLR photography, sharp focus, 4K quality.
